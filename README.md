# simpleSnakeGame
This game is basically a tutorial on how javascript can work in a game setting.

Its a simple game (the basic version of those old snake games you used to play on your old button phones).

The goal of the game is to score the highest score while avoiding the snake tail and the walls

The snake grows as it eats the fruit and that is how you score points.

I want to try to get the basics done and then hopefully make this into a more visually apealling experience.
